Ideas for Local State exercises:

Important points:
* Should demonstrate:
  * Local variables.
  * ENTER and LEAVE
  * Examples without ENTER and LEAVE.
  * Using constant labels to access variables and arguments?

Read Code
---------

-   (Islands) DFS algorithm for graphs. Find the connected components. (Bonus?)
-   Calculating Catalan's numbers. (Have to keep all previous numbers?)

?   Work on strings inside local memory?

-   Calculating determinant? (Recursive?)

-   Matrix multiplication ?

-   Complex numbers multiplication

-   Levenshtein distance.

-   gcd.
    - Adding fractions? Fractions library?

-   Binary GCD algorithm.
    -- done (Stein)

-   Reverse polish notation calculation?

-   Print stack trace? (Follow EBP?)
    -- done (Way home)

-   push by call trick:

  call loc
    db  'asdfjlkjfsdfsdf'
  loc:
    call func

    -- done (String in the sleeve)

-   Array bubble sort.
    -- done (Bubbles)

?   Concepts to cover:
    - Jump table (Case)
      -- done something similar. (Call table)
    - Functional programming?
    - Stack trace by ebp?
      -- done (way home).



Write Code
----------

-   Matrix multiplication.
    Calculating fibonacci numbers using 2X2 matrices.
    1 1
    1 0
    To the power of n gives fibonacci numbers.
    -- done (Matrix fibonacci).

-   Complex numbers.

-   Fractions:
    -- done (Basel)
    - Addition of fractions.

    - Approximating pi^2
